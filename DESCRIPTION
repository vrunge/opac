Description: Optimal partitioning algorithms with optimization-based pruning rules. For a few change-point problems with 2D parameter description, we propose acceleration strategies called OP1D, OP2D and OPAC. The latter is an exact pruning method. The two first are easier to implement and lead to a significant time complexity reduction.
